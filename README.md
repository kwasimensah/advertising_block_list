## Synopsis

A default list of sites to not include in your Facebook ad campaigns.

## Motivation

I got bit by having one of my Facebook ads show up Breitbart, a site I never wanted to be affiliated with. Thanks to the people watching the site as part of the [Sleeping Giants](https://twitter.com/slpng_giants) movement, I got alerted and learned to use the advance settings to control which sites my ad shows up on.  I didn't find anyone else sharing a list of sites to avoid so I threw this together on GitHub as this would be the easiest way I know to accept community changes.

## Installation

Download default_block_list.txt and upload it to Facebook following the instructions at https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1314478651899918?hc_location=ufi

## Contributors

While this is not officially affiliated with [Sleeping Giants](https://twitter.com/slpng_giants), I'd love it if they could take this over :)
